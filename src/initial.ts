     * to load, there is something funky that happens along that transition
     * where the transition never happens.
     *
     * I theorize that it is because the initial className never makes it to
     * the DOM due to a timing issue.
     *
     * I thought maybe we were just punting the problem to 950ms instead, but
     * testing with 950ms delay (950ms + 50ms = 1000ms) seems to work fine.
     *
     * So unless we can clearly rule out the cause, I suggest we keep this
     * code in.

 * less and the complexity of a fade-out is higher. This is because we need a
