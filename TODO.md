# To Do

- [ ] Fix needed to us `as const` in `demo.tsx` by using TypeScript `infer`
- [ ] In the Position presets, I think instead of using `srcRef` it can be more generic and use `src`. Need to think about this. Will need a bit more scaffolding but it's also easier to understand and more flexible.
